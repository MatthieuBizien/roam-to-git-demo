# roam-to-git-demo (caffo's fork)

![Roam Research backup](https://github.com/caffo/roam-to-git-demo/workflows/Roam%20Research%20backup/badge.svg)

Welcome to the demo of my fork of [roam-to-git](https://github.com/caffo/roam-to-git)!

You can [modify this roam instance](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/caffo-roam-to-git) and see the results being stored here. Because we backup every hour, latency can be up to 1h.

The directories are:
- markdown/ for the raw markdown export of Roam
- json/ for the raw json export of Roam
- formatted for a cool formatting with backlinks
- edn for edn files
